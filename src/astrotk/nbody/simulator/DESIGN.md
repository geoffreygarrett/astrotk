# Design Approach
The project will provide and academic oriented software solution to learning & understanding the implementation of 
the n-body problem in astrodynamics using Python and C++ accelerated bindings to create a simulation.

## Project Objectives
1. The project shall allow for comparisons between different integrations schemes in the n-body simulation.
2. The project shall allow for the use of difference frames of reference.
3. The project shall allow for the use of any set of initial conditions for the n-body simulation.
4. The project shall allow for the comparison between C++ accelerated binding and pure Python based code.

## Stakeholders
1. **Students** must be able to follow and learn from the simple and concise implementation of astrodynamics used to
create a n-body gravatational simulator.
2. The **Professor** must be able to potentially use the simulation as an idealistic implementation of an n-body 
simulation using Python with C++ bindings for accelerated performance.
3. The **Developers** must be able to come to a full understanding of n-body gravatational simulations using C++ 
accelerated code bindings in future development projects.

## Design Requirements
1. The software shall allow for the use of alternative integration schemes.
2. The software shall allow for the use of alternative frames of reference.
3. The software shall allow for the tracking of all states across all time periods.
4. The software shall allow for visual inspection of all states.

## Stakeholder Requirements
1. The software shall have clear and concise documentation in the form of code-commenting.
2. The software shall have clear and concise documentation in the form of markdown documentation.
3. The theory, equations and techniques used shall be fulled cited to sources.
4. The software shall allow for the comparison of different integration schemes showing their respective strengths and 
weaknesses.
