Why :cyan:`astrotk`?
********************

In a few words, because space is my passion. In decidedly more words, because it seemed like a logical way to put theory
to practice and a good opportunity to demonstrate a legacy left behind by a great mind, Richard Feynmann: The Feynman
Technique. The structure of this library will be educationally oriented in addition to powerful tools that allow for
various methods taught during my education at TU Delft. This library is therefore is a gift from me to the young minds
that choose to pursue a career in space. With Python becoming an ever increasingly popular choice for scientific
computing, it is my intention to demonstrate conventions and theory in Python, Astrodynamics, Computational & Numerical
Analysis, and other courses that will inevitably inspire new functionality somewhere down the line of it's development.
